                <p>Sure whatever suits you best. You can also dictate your opinion on Koo by clicking on + ü°¢ üó£ and voila you are now having a hands free experience. Here is a small trivia. Did you know Koo is the Ô¨Årst social media platform to release this feature in the whole world?</p>
                <div className="h2">Q. Can I edit a Koo?</div>
                <p>Yes you can edit a Koo if there has been no interaction from the community. If the Koo has been viewed or has any user engagement and you would still like to edit, it is best to delete the Koo and post a new one.</p>
                <div className="h2">Q. Can I customise the colour of the UI?</div>
                <p>There are currently three view customisations currently available namely Dark, Light and System. Dark is where the background of the app is darker and is comfortable for the eyes in low light situations. Light view is a brighter background of the app. System is based on the system settings if dark mode gets enabled on your phone then the same happens on the app. You can change the settings by clicking ProÔ¨Åle Picture ü°¢ ‚öô ü°¢ Theme.</p>
